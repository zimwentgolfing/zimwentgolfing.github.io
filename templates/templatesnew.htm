<h1 class="H1GreenLongBckgrd" style="text-align: left">Tournament Manager 2006 
(What’s New)</h1>

<h3 class="H3LightGreenLongBckgrd" style="text-align: left">New Sorting Options</h3>

<p style="text-align: left">The “Tournament Sheet” (view on the main screen) can 
now be sorted by teams. (Used to sort only by players). You no longer have to go 
to reports to sort how teams are displayed. Sort by any team criteria….tee time, 
start hole, team flight, team handicap, team score, etc. <br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="H3LightGreenLongBckgrd" style="text-align: left">New Skins Options</h3>

<p style="text-align: left">Skins are now highlighted in color. <br>
Option to set a maximum allowed handicap for net skins.<br>
Plus, you also have the option to restrict the number of stokes allowed on par 
3,4,5,6 to any value.<br>
Option to highlight “Deuces” on skins report.</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><br>

<p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-size: 8pt">(sample skins report)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="H3LightGreenLongBckgrd" style="text-align: left">New m-Match 
(Many-Matches) feature.</h3>

<p style="text-align: left"><u><span class="HighLightGreen">Individual matches</span></u><br>
Lets you build and report ANY number of individual match pairings for each 
golfer. You can specify matches one by one, or click the “Build All Possible 
Matches” button and let TM build all possible matches for you in seconds. For 
example, if you had a tournament with 24 golfers the number of possible 
individual matches is 276 = (23+22+21…etc…+3+2+1)<br>
<br>
<span class="HighLightGreen"><u>Team matches</u><b><br>
</b></span>Plus you can build any number of team match pairings. This means each 
golfer can play as a team with and against any possible combination of other 
players. <br>
<br>
To show results, simply go to the “m-Match” report. TM produces a report for 
each golfer showing all matches (individual and team) with net and gross 
results.</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><br>

<span style="font-size: 8pt">(sample m-match report)</span></p>

<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="H3LightGreenLongBckgrd" style="text-align: left">New Flighting 
Options</h3>

<p style="text-align: left">New option to flight golfers based on index or 
multi-decimal point handicap. You can also automatically flight men and women 
separately. Plus, if you “manually” set flight ranges, TM automatically saves 
these ranges from session to session…so re-entry is no longer required.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="H3LightGreenLongBckgrd" style="text-align: left">New “Play with All” 
scheduling</h3>

<p style="text-align: left">TM does a much better job guaranteeing that each 
player will play each other an equal number of times while also rotating 
different tee-times / start holes. You can now adjust the number of events you 
wish to play across. Quick view lets you see the number of times a player will 
play each other and number of times a tee-time/start-hole will be played <br>
<br>

<span style="font-size: 8pt">(play with all stats)</span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="H3LightGreenLongBckgrd" style="text-align: left">New “Report Finder”</h3>

<p style="text-align: left">The new “Report Finder” catalogs reports into 
different categories with a complete description of what each report shows. It's 
easy to find the report you need. And the “My Favorite” option allows you to 
select often used reports with just one double-click.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class="H3LightGreenLongBckgrd" style="text-align: left">New “Team Results 
Report Builder”</h3>

<p style="text-align: left">Now you can specify exactly which scores from which 
players will be used on which holes. This allows you to build practically any 
type of team results report in which a golfer plays his/her own ball. The number 
of types of team reports you can build is literally infinite. Also includes 
building multi-round team results. Standings can be based on scores (gross and 
net) or even points.<br>
<br>
Several sample reports have already been designed to give you an idea of what 
can be done. </p>
<ul class="BulletXBox">
  <li>

<p style="text-align: left">(1 Gross and 1 Net Best Ball) – Team’s score is 
based on 1 gross best ball and 1 net best ball from each hole.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">(123 Net Best Ball Waltz) – Team’s score is based on 
one net best ball on hole 1, two net best balls on hole 2, three best balls on 
hole 3, one net best ball on hole 4, etc...</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">(AC Net Best Ball and BD Net Best Ball) – Team’s 
score is the total of player 1 and 3's net best ball and player 2 and 4's net 
best ball.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">(Colored Net Ball) –Team’s score is based on colored 
ball and 1 net best ball of other three players. Each player alternates playing 
the colored ball on each hole. Player 1 plays colored ball first, player 2 plays 
colored ball on next hole, etc...</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">(Low Net Ball and High Net Ball) – Team’s score is 
based on low net ball and high net ball on each hole.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">(Net Best Ball Mix) – Team’s score is based on 1 net 
best ball from holes 1 to 9, 2 net best ball for holes 10 to 17, and 3 best net 
balls for hole 18.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">(Pros Ball and Amateurs Gross Best Ball) –Team’s 
score is based on the pro's score (player 1 on the team) and the 1 gross best 
ball of the 3 amateurs.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">(Odd holes only) – Team’s score is based on scores 
only on odd holes.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left">These are just samples of what can be done. You have 
the option of setting up different criteria on 90 different holes! That’s 
different criteria for each hole of a five-round tournament. The possibilities 
are endless.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: left">You also have complete control of what information 
appears on the report.</p>
<ul class="BulletXBox">
  <li>

<p style="text-align: left">Report Range - Report on any range of holes. Up to 
90 holes for a 5 round tournament.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">How Report is Sorted - Sort by any value. Team 
Flights, Front, Back, Totals, Multiple Round Totals. Sort by score and/or 
points. Includes tie breaking options: USGA tiebreak, Handicap Hole Tiebreak, 
Sequential, Reverse Sequential, etc...</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">Report Header and Body - You have complete control 
of what appears on the report’s header and body. Option to display pars, hole 
handicaps, totals, hole-by-hole details, team flights, team results (scores 
and/or points), team positions, itemized player info, player’s results (scores 
and/or points), how strokes are applied, team positions, etc. You even have 
the option to “highlight” which player’s scores were selected to form the team 
score.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left">All these options, but VERY easy to use!</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Several new fields can now be included in the “body” 
of any custom view or custom report: tournament name, tournament date, 
hole-by-hole gross points and net points, course rating, course slope, 
tournament ID#, round number, and course number.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">New team pairing 2 column sheet that collapses team 
pairings to a concise 2 column sheet format.</li>

<p style="text-align: left">New ”abbreviated” team pairing sheet. Displays all 
golfers on each team on one line. Each golfer’s name can be in a separate 
column.</li>

sorted to the 100th decimal place for fractional handicap tiebreaking.</li>

you wish….Team #, Group #, Foursome #....anything. Even the player’s names on 
the team can make up the team name.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">Option to set a maximum allowed handicap for a 
tournament. </li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">Option to import data from other software into a 
tournament. Works just like the roster data import except the data is imported 
into the active tournament.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">Net score is displayed while entering score cards.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">Option to print “Start Time” and/or “Start Hole” on 
the scorecard, team pairing sheet and labels.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">A “?” help box on each player’s form lets you see 
exactly how the gross and tournament handicap are calculated.</li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">The tee color is now displayed on the player’s form 
so it is easy to see what tee group corresponds to what tee color. </li>
<li>

<p style="text-align: left">For multi-round tournaments, the “team” flight can 
now be carried forward from round to round. <br>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="H2GreenLongBckgrd" style="text-align: left">Tournament Manager 2004 - 
2005</h2>
<h2 class="H2LightGreenLongBckgrd">Built in “Website Designer”</h2>



<p>Tournament Manager’s new built in “Website Designer” provides a “turnkey” solution 
for placing all your organization’s pertinent information on the web. There is 
no site hosting/server to set up, no user name and passwords to remember, no 
special software to load, no programming to learn. Publishing your organization’s 
website is completely automatic.<br>
<br>
This means any report, view, or <u>any</u> information that you would usually print to 
paper can be placed on your own organization’s website. The players love it because 
all of the tournament's information is at their fingertips on the Internet. All 
members have online access to membership rosters, schedules, signup sheets, 
pairings, tee times, handicapping reports, tournament standings, individual standings, 
team standings, game results, tournament rules &amp; documents, photos, emails, announcements, etc. Bottom line, any 
information you wish can appear on your website. And you don’t even have to be 
connected to the internet to build your website! Build your website offline 
(not connected to the internet) and update changes only when you are ready to 
connect.<br>
&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><b><span class="HighLightGreen">Why do I need a Website?</span></b> <br>
The question really should be, how can you do <u>without</u> a website? <br>
&nbsp;<br>
A website lets you….</p>



<ul class="BulletXBox">
  <li>Provide instant updated information to all your members. <i>Member 
  directories, schedules, tee times, pairings, results, leader boards, event 
  details, directions, online sign-ups, event cancellations, etc.</i></li>
  <li>Information is available 24 hours a day.</li>
  <li>Information can be accessed from any computer anywhere.</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;<br>
Your benefit…</p>



<ul class="BulletXBox">
  <li>Saves a tremendous amount of time. <i>Example: Rain is predicted. Will the 
  event be cancelled? How many phone calls will you get? Post an event 
  cancellation notice on your website’s homepage. </i></li>
  <li>Saves money. <i>Example: Do you send out costly and time consuming 
  mailings or emails to update information, schedule, pairings, results, etc? 
  Your website is open 24/7. No need to print out endless copies of reports or 
  send endless emails. Paper, postage, ink, etc, costs are zero.</i></li>
  <li>Reduces errors. <i>Example: A result sheet shows an incorrect score. A 
  member will let you know.</i></li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;<br>
Members benefit…</p>



<ul class="BulletXBox">
  <li>Better informed. Information is just a few clicks away.</li>
  <li>Members feel better. An informed membership feels included and 
  well-serviced. They feel like they are not “bugging” you all the time.</li>
  <li>Saves time. Members can get complete, updated information at their 
  convenience.</li>
</ul>



<p><br>
&nbsp;<b>Bottom line, your website will streamline your operations and become your 
greatest asset.<br>
&nbsp;</b></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>
<br>
<span class="HighLightGreen"><b>How do you do it?</b></span></p>



<ol>
  <li>Select any reports, views, or sheets to include on your tournament’s website.</li>
  <li>Use the “Website Designer” to specify the order in which pages will appear on 
your site. </li>

<ul class="BulletXGreenBox">
  <li>Basic Level - Simply put any report or view on your website and click publish.</li>
  <li>Advanced Level- If you want a more sophisticated site, Website Designer lets you 
create web pages with anything on them and practically any format you wish. And 
Website Designer offers the flexibility to alter any page to your exact 
specification. Text can be inserted anywhere. Font size, style, type, alignment, 
etc, can be set to anything. Rows and columns can be added, deleted, resized. 
Pictures and graphics can also be inserted. Background colors and font colors 
can be customized too. You can even set hyperlinks to other pages or websites. 
Insert announcement pages, tournament rules, signup info, favorite links, photo 
albums, and any other type of documents you wish. You can even import text or 
Excel sheets to your website.<br>
  <br>

&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="H2LightGreenLongBckgrd">Built in Editor</h2>

<p>New editor lets you edit any report, view, schedule or sheet. Reports and views 
can be altered, saved, printed, sent to the web, and retrieved later with all 
changes saved. If you are familiar with “Excel” (Microsoft’s spreadsheet 
program), the editor works just like that program. Text can be inserted, 
deleted, and edited. &nbsp;Fonts size, style, type, alignment, etc, can be set to 
anything. Pictures can also be added. Background colors and font colors can be 
customized too. Plus, rows and columns can be added, deleted, and resized. Copy, 
cut, paste any text. Basically anything you can do in a spreadsheet can be done 
to a report, view, schedule or sheet.<br>

<h2 class="H2GreenLongBckgrd">Tournament Manager 9.0 (2001 - 2003)</h2>

<h3><u><span class="HighLightGreen">Easier to use</span></u></h3>

<p>Tournament Manager has been completely redesigned to make the software more 
intuitive and allow for the fastest manipulation and changing of data possible. 
I can honestly say this is the biggest upgrade we have ever had. Tournament 
Manager 9.0 puts version 8.0 to shame! No more closing forms and jumping back 
and forth between screens. We have eliminated the signup sheet, pairing sheet, 
and posting sheet and replaced them with one simple to use form. No more closing 
forms to see or make changes to Tournament Parameters. Just click on the 
“Tournament Parameters” tab and there it is! Plus, all reports are on one menu. 
No more running back and forth between pairing and posting sheets to show 
pairing reports and result reports. Simply click reports and select the report 
you wish to view.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

</a>
<a href="../../images/tm9001.jpg">
<img border="1" src="../../images/tm9001_small.jpg" xthumbnail-orig-image="../images/tm9001.jpg" width="100" height="83"></a>

<p>
<br>
TM now lets you see, right on the main screen, which team each golfer is on. No 
more guessing who’s where! Two basic views are provided…“Players Only View” and 
“Teams View”. The “Players Only View” hides the teams and simply shows a list of 
players (like version 8.0). The new “Teams View” lets you see who’s on what team 
and the order of players on each team. Plus NOW you have the capability to 
customize the items that appear in each view. In other words, you have complete 
control of what you see on the screen.<br>
<br>
Signing up a golfer is more intuitive. If you are running a “pick your partner” 
tournament simply drag the golfer from the member roster and drop on the correct 
team. You can even highlight multiple players and with one click put them on the 
same team. TM uses the standard Windows keys to drag, drop, and copy items from 
one list to another. Need to reposition a player on his/her team? Need to move a 
golfer from one team to another? Now you can simply drag the golfer you want to 
move, and drop him/her onto the spot you want them to go. Before you had to 
double-click the player to pull up his information form, type in the correct 
team number, then close the form…a slow and cumbersome process. Now just drag 
and drop. You can still do it the old way if you want, but why waste time? 
Previously there was no way to “manually” reposition golfers on teams. But those 
days are gone. Now just drag and drop!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Information is now just one click away. Right-click the golfer and all his/her 
information is immediately available. This means you can change a golfer’s 
“Roster” info (name, address, tournament defaults, etc.) at any time, even while 
viewing him/her in the tournament…no more running back to the “Membership 
Roster” to change a golfer’s global information. This is also true for the 
golfer’s tournament and score card information. Plus, team information can also 
be quickly changed. Simply click the team and there is the team’s name, flight, 
tee-time, etc.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Change information or perform an “action” on a group of golfers with just one 
keystroke! Highlight multiple golfers to set flights, tees, lock on teams, add 
to tournament, set in a particular roster, etc. Any change that can be made to a 
single golfer can also be made to a selected group of golfers. Example: Need to 
delete several golfers? Simply highlight all the golfers to delete and click the 
DELETE button. Need to put a selected set of golfers on a particular tee or 
flight? Just highlight the golfers and set the tee/flight. One key stroke can 
change the value for any number of players…what could be faster or easier?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul class="BulletXBox">
  <li>No more cryptic letter names for rosters (A,B,C, etc..). Rosters can now be 
given a full name up to 40 characters in length.</li>
  <li>The form to assign tee-times and start-holes has been completely redesigned to 
make it a much faster process. </li>
  <li>Any tournament setup can be the default for the next tournament you create.</li>
  <li>Have a question about how a player’s tournament handicap was calculated? 
Simply click on the handicaps and TM explains exactly how the golfer’s handicap 
was calculated.</li>
  <li>Any screen can be resized. No more awkward ‘close’ buttons!</li>
  <li>Plus many other improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&nbsp;<br>
<u><span class="HighLightGreen">Custom Columnar Reports</span></u></h3>

<p>Now you can create <b>custom reports!</b> &nbsp;Display any item, in any column, sorted in 
any fashion. Plus any number of report layouts can be created and saved for 
later use. </p>

<ul class="BulletXStar">
  <li>This means you can create almost any kind of columnar report. For example, 
assume you want to create a simple directory of players showing just name, email 
address, and phone number…this can be done. Or suppose you want a signup sheet 
with each golfer’s name, handicap, phone number, and preferred tee time. Or 
perhaps you want a detailed standings report that shows each player’s flight, 
name, hole by hole score, total gross, handicap, net score, sorted by flight and 
then net score to show flighted standings low to high. It takes only a couple 
minutes to format such a report layout, which can then be saved and used at any 
time. Any number of report layouts can be created. Several sample custom reports 
have already been created for you to use.</li>
  <li>Custom reports can be altered at any time…new columns added, edited and 
deleted.</li>
  <li>Sort reports in any fashion. Reports can be sorted by up to three columns 
simultaneously. Assume you wanted a report to show flights, sub-sorted by 
gender, with handicaps low to high. Click the SORT button and set your report to 
sort first by flight, then gender, and finally handicap. Change the sorted order 
of a report at any time.</li>
  <li>Almost any item related to the golfer can be displayed on custom reports. Plus 
many new items (not available in the “canned” reports) can be placed on custom 
reports.</li>
  <li>Filter out and display only the golfers you wish to show. Report only men, 
women, seniors, only golfers in specific flights or groups, etc. Plus you can 
show multiple flights or groups on one report for multi-flight sheets.</li>
  <li>Column headers and report titles can be anything you wish. Plus you control 
column widths, row heights, font types, sizes and styles. Font sizes can be 
anywhere from 8pt to 72pt in size…that is very small type to 1 inch high. Print 
on any size paper, letter, legal, etc. You can even print reports on a plotter 
and display on a billboard if desired.</li>
  <li>Custom reports are in addition to the “Standard” reports. If you prefer the 
standard preset reports they are all still available.</li>
</ul>

<h3><br>
<span class="HighLightGreen"><u>Custom Views</u></span></h3>

<p><br>
Just like custom reports, now you can create custom views! The old Tournament 
Manager allowed only three views of your data (signup, pairing, and posting). 
Now you can create any view you want. Views work just like custom reports. You 
can show any data field for any golfer or team, in any order, sorted in any 
fashion. It’s simply how you view your information on the main screen. With two 
double-clicks of the mouse you can change from one view to another view. 
Fourteen sample list views have already been created for you to preview. They 
include: </p>

<ul class="BulletXArrow">
  <li>Phone numbers and email addresses – Shows each golfer’s name, phone #s and 
email addresses.</li>
  <li>Pairings – Each golfer’s name, handicap, gender, tee, tee time, start hole, 
cart# and phone number.</li>
  <li>Gross Results with stats – Shows each golfer’s name, gross score, putts, 
fairways, greens, earnings, eagles, birdies, pars, bogeys, etc.</li>
  <li>Hole-by hole results – Displays each golfer’s name, flight, hole-by-hole 
score, front total, back total, gross total, handicap and net.</li>
  <li>Results for all rounds – Each golfer with all his/her itemized round totals. 
Round #1 stats, round #2 stats, round #3 stats, etc. And totals for all rounds.</li>
  <li>Plus others…</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
Views can be set to show team and/or players only. You can sort views by any 
column. Plus players on a team can be sub-sorted in any fashion. Column widths 
can be adjusted to any size. Font types can even be changed. And just like 
custom reports, any list view can be printed. In other words, you can create a 
custom view of information you want to view while entering data, and click PRINT 
at any time to send the view to the printer or your website. Many tournament 
managers may find this is the only view/report they need. Note: If you prefer 
the “old” TM 8.x views, they are still available. Remember, you can create any 
type of view!</p>

<h3>&nbsp;<br>
<span class="HighLightGreen"><u>Save reports and lists as HTML files or to Microsoft Excel
</u></span></h3>

<p>Save any custom report or view into a HTML file format or to an Excel 
Spreadsheet. HTML is the universal format for viewing on the web or transferring 
reports and data from one program to another. This means you can view/import 
into any program that supports HTML without losing any formatting. </p>

<ul class="BulletXBox">
  <li>Publish reports and lists directly to your website.</li>
  <li>Pass reports to organization members. As long as they have a web browser, MS 
Word, MS Excel, or any program that reads HTML they can view the report. Most 
programs now support HTML.</li>
  <li>Export data to any program. Simply build a custom report with only the items 
you wish to export, generate the report and save as a HTML file for import into 
a database or spreadsheet program.</li>
</ul>

<h3><br>
<span class="HighLightGreen"><u>New custom “fields”</u></span></h3>

<p>Custom fields let you track any information you want. Ten text fields, five 
currency fields, and two date fields, can be named anything you wish to track 
any data you need. These fields can appear on any custom report or custom list 
view. Also new home address, work address, email, fax number, membership dues, 
payment info, due dates, and comments have been added to track this additional 
information if needed. Any of these fields can appear on any custom report or 
view you create.</p>

<h3><br>
<span class="HighLightGreen"><u>What else is new:</u></span></h3>

<ul class="BulletXBox">
  <li>Up to 8 players per team (was 6).</li>
  <li>Up to 5 rounds per tournament (was 4).</li>
  <li>No limit on the number of tees that can be played (was 2 for men and 2 for 
women).</li>
  <li>For multi-round tournaments, each round can now be played on a different golf 
course.</li>
  <li>Option to flight teams. Up to 26 flights (A-Z). Just like players, teams can 
be automatically flighted by team handicap or scores from previous rounds. Plus 
you can manually flight teams by any criteria. Simply highlight the team(s) and 
set the flight. Any team results report can be sorted to show flight winners.</li>
  <li>Courses can now be assigned any hole numbers. For example if you are playing 
on holes 10-27 of a 27 hole course…holes 10-27 will display correctly on any 
scorecard or any other report.</li>
  <li>Golfers can now have a different handicap in each round of a multi-round 
tournament.</li>
  <li>Running a team tournament with uneven number of players? Now “Blind Draws” are 
automatically available for signup. Any number of “Blind Draws” can participate 
in a tournament.</li>
  <li>Option to give each team a “team name”. Team names appear on any pairing 
sheet, scorecard, results report, custom reports, etc. Note: TM 8.0 named team 
#1 as ‘Team #1, team #2 as ‘Team #2’’, etc…this is still the default.</li>
  <li>Any number of “sub” start holes can be assigned (start hole 1A, 1B, 1C, etc.) 
Auto assign tee-times and start hole to any or all teams. The “Tee-time” form 
lets you quickly assign tee-times, start-holes and cart numbers. No more having 
to pull up a separate form to change each item.</li>
  <li>If you run quota point tournaments: Point Quotas can now be typed in or 
calculated from a golfer’s handicap. Whole number or fractional quotas (up to 2 
decimal places) can be used. Display points, quota, standings (points-quota) on 
any team reports, individual reports, scorecards or any custom view or report. 
Points can be shown on hole-by-hole basis and/or totals.</li>
  <li>Advanced users: If you adjust handicaps for play from multiple tees, you can 
now select which tee(s) receives the adjustment and by how much, up or down.</li>
  <li>“Play With All” pairing has been optimized and will find not merely a good 
solution, but the best possible solution.</li>
  <li>Handicap System users: Tournament Manager integrates very tightly with Handicap 
  Systemx. You can 
now transfer the exact same data fields in HS including any of the miscellaneous 
customizable fields. Plus a new option to transfer 9-hole tournament scores back 
to an 18-hole Handicap System roster. (Two nines are combined to form an 18-hole 
score)</li>
  <li>Net result reports can show each gross score hole-by-hole and how many strokes 
were given on each hole.</li>
  <li>Base net skins on any handicap percentage. Example: You could show net skins 
based on 50% (any percent) of a golfer’s handicap.</li>
  <li>Show net scramble results based on team handicaps.</li>
  <li>Plus dozens of other new features!<br>
