    <td style="FONT-SIZE: 13px"><b>How the Forum Works</b><br>
    Forums are the categories of different discussions you want your site 
    visitors to participate in. Only you can define Forums. Once these are 
    defined, either you or your site visitors can start Topics within any 
    particular forum. <br>
    <br>
    For example, if you created a Forum called &quot;Recipes&quot; a site visitor might 
    come in and start a Topic within that forum called &quot;Cheese Omelet&quot;. At 
    least, that would be the Subject (or Title) of the Topic. Then, in the 
    Topic's post box, he would input the actual ingredients and instructions for 
    making a Cheese Omelet. Once there are Topics within a Forum, people can 
    begin to post Replies. Replies are comments posted in direct response to a 
    Topic. So let's say that Cheese Omelet Topic called for 2 eggs, but someone 
    tried the recipe and used 3 eggs and it came out better. That person would 
    then post a Reply to the Topic and discuss how he made the recipe better.
    <br>
    <br>
    An infinite number of Topics are allowed within any Forum, and users may 
    post an infinite number of Replies to each Topic. This is how a user 
    community grows and interacts with each other on the web, thanks to Forums 
    like this one.</td>
