Don’t touch or move your ball (even if it has mud on it). The only exceptions to this are if you are on the green (where you are allowed to mark your ball and clean it, if you so desire) or if you cannot identify your ball (in which case, you may move it just enough to see if it is yours but must put it back in the position it was in).<br><br>2) If the ball is inadvertently knocked off the tee while a player is addressing the ball, the ball may be re-teed with no penalty. If, however, a stroke is made under these circumstances (this includes “whiffs”), the stroke counts.<br><br>3) If your ball hits another ball, replace the ball that you hit to the spot it was originally in. Leave your ball where it is.<br><br>4) If a ball is accidentally deflected or stopped by an opponent or his equipment, no penalty is incurred. You may either play the ball as it lies or cancel the stroke and replay the shot.<br><br>5) Don't move, bend, or break anything growing or fixed, except in fairly taking your stance or swing. Don't press anything down. You may lift natural objects not fixed or growing, except in a water hazard or bunker, without any penalty. <br><br>6) You may move man-made objects even in a bunker or water hazard. If they are immovable, you may drop within one clublength of the nearest point of relief (unless your ball is in a water hazard), no nearer the hole, without any penalty. In a bunker, you must drop in the bunker, without any penalty.<br><br>7) In a water hazard or bunker, don't touch the water or ground with your hand or club before the stroke. For instance, if you take a practice swing in a bunker and your club hits the sand, this is a one-stroke penalty. <br><br>8) When you hit your ball out of bounds, lose it, or have an unplayable lie, you must add a penalty stroke and hit your next shot from one of the following:<br> a. Where the ball went out of bounds or was lost<br> b. From the same spot that your previous shot was from<br> c. If you decide that your lie is unplayable (note that you can decide this whenever you wish), you may hit your next shot from one of the 2 previously mentioned spots (a or b) OR you may drop within two clublengths from your ball, no nearer the hole, or any distance behind the unplayable spot, keeping it between you and the hole. If the ball is in a bunker, you must drop in the bunker, under any of these alternative options. <br><br>Note that when a ball is lost, the newly dropped ball becomes the “ball in play” once it is hit. You must play this ball for the rest of the hole even if you find your original ball.<br><br>Also, note that this rule differs slightly from the USGA rule. The USGA handles out of bounds differently than this league and advocates hitting “provisional” balls. We do not hit provisionals in this league.<br><br>9) You may drop away from casual water, ground under repair, burrowing animal holes or their casts, or cart paths. On the putting green, place at the nearest point of relief, no nearer the hole; otherwise drop within one clublength of the nearest point of relief. In a bunker, the ball must be dropped in the bunker. If complete relief is impossible within the bunker, drop in the bunker at the point of maximum available relief. (In all cases, there is no penalty.) <br><br>10) If you hit your ball into a water hazard and cannot play it, either drop behind the hazard or at the place you played the shot. (One penalty stroke.) If you hit into a lateral hazard you may also drop within two clublengths of the point where the ball last crossed the hazard margin, or a point equidistant from the hole on the opposite margin. (One penalty stroke.) </td> <td width="10" height="40" class="GreenPastelBackground">&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="10"> </td> <td valign="bottom" class="GreenPastelBackground"> <img src="../images/corner-white-bottom-left.gif" width="10" height="10"></td> <td width="486" class="GreenPastelBackground">&nbsp;</td> <td align="right" valign="bottom" class="GreenPastelBackground"> <img src="../images/corner-white-bottom-right.gif" width="10" height="10"></td> </tr> </table><br><br></body></html>
